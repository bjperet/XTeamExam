My approach to the X-Team Java Exam

  The project, XTeamExam, can be found at github.com/bjperet.

	Install node if not installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  
	In terminal, navigate to folder containing project (xTeamExam)
  
	Enter command   node www/bin
  
	The service should now be 'Listening on port 3210'
  
	Get requests can be made using curl in terminal
  Sample: curl  http://localhost:3210/api/recent_purchases?username=Jarret_Schumm
